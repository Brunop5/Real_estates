# Real Estate Web Scraper
My personal script for scraping info and contact on as many slovak real estate agencies as possible.
I wanted to use the scraped data for business purposes.

## Features
- this simple project is separated into 4 python scripts:
  - nehnutelnosti.py (scrapes data from nehnutelnosti.sk)
  - realitymax.py (realitymax.sk)
  - topreality.py
  - send_mails.py (sends emails to the scraped email addresses) - this script relies on an outside script not contained in this repo
## Tech Stack
- I used python with just two libraries - pandas and selenium

## Disclaimer
- This script was created in 2023 as a fun side project and has not been maintained since.
- Due to website changes over time, the scraper may require updates to work properly now.
- Feel free to try it out, but expect to do some minor fixes.
