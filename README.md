# Real Estate Web Scraper
My personal script for scraping info and contact on as many slovak real estate agencies as possible.
I wanted to use the scraped data for business purposes.

## Features
- this simple project is separated into 4 python scripts:
  - nehnutelnosti.py (scrapes data from nehnutelnosti.sk)
  - realitymax.py (realitymax.sk)
  - topreality.py
  - send_mails.py (sends emails to the scraped email addresses) - this script relies on an outside script not contained in this repo
## Tech Stack
- I used python with just two libraries - pandas and selenium

## Disclaimer
- this script was created in 2023 just for a fun and short idea, since then I havent touched the idea or the script.
- the likelyhood of such webscraping script working after two years of no maintaining are incredibly low, but whoever wants to try it, it should work with some minor updates.
